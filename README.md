# Josh Medeski's Zsh Theme
A simple, clean and feature filled zsh-theme.

## TODO

- [ ] Show short hash of last commit (see [xfanwu/xxf.zsh-theme](https://gist.github.com/xfanwu/18fd7c24360c68bab884))
- [ ] Integrate [gitster](https://github.com/shashankmehta/dotfiles/blob/master/thesetup/zsh/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/gitster.zsh-theme)
- [ ] Use [octicat](https://octicons.github.com/) font to show repo icon (book) when in git repo (using gitster functionality)
- [ ] Submit to [awesome-shell](https://github.com/alebcay/awesome-shell)!
- [ ] Add indicator if local branch is out-of-date from tracked branch
- [ ] Write setup instructions (in this readme)

> Gister - When in a git repo, it shows the location from the git's root folder. When not in a git repo, it shows the path relative to home, ~.
